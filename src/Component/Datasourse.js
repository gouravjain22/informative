About 6 feet in height and 100 feet long, the temple sits majestically on a high and wide platform. There are many sculptures of gods, goddesses, dancers, apsaras, sages, scenes from the Puranas, Shiva in various forms such as Nataraja, Andhakantaka, and Vinadhara, as well as repetitive floral, geometric, animal, bird, and auspicious Hindu motifs on the external facades.
